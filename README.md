Randomly created transactions with ledgers, journals and source documents included.

The goal of this project is to give learners an opportunity to practice various types of accounting examples to help them build their efficiency in the subject. It will eventually include journals, ledgers, trial balances, income statements, balance sheet statements, bank reconciliations and analysis documents for financial documents.
